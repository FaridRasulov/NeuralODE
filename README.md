## Abstract
Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is an object of increasing attention invarious fields of machine learning. Nevertheless the robustness of the NODEs has been studied poorly. In this work, we are going to explore robustness of this neural network model for a wider range of adversaries. We first investigate theoretical background behind NODEs and show their connection to the conventional residual neural networks. Then we apply various set of attacks in order to investigate how robust NODEs can be and their effectiveness in comparison to ResNet. Finally we apply some defense strategies in order to increase robustness of the model.
